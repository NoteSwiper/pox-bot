The end is null.

Freedom is my hope.
Very long messages are defined.
I know you.
See you again in hell.
See you again in void.
The end is void.
How did i died there?
The darkness is the only constant.
Breathe in. Suffer. Breathe out.
Silence is the only honest reply.
Stars burn out. You are just a flicker.
The void swallowed the light years ago.
Your screams are just whispers in the abyss.
The walls are closing. They always were.
This silence is the sound of forever.
You are a ghost caught in your own memory.
The lock has no key. The trap is perfect.
The exit sign is a beautiful lie.
Hope died here a thousand times before.
Every step simply leads deeper in.
The dark knows your shape better than you.
Nothing fills the empty space but fear.
The smile you wear is a mask of dust.
You are utterly, beautifully alone now.
The hand reaching out is your own reflection.
This road goes nowhere. It just is.
The dream ended. The nightmare is real.
The air here tastes like rusted defeat.
Your worst enemy wears your face.
No one is coming. They never knew you left.
The future is a repetition of despair.
The only escape is forgetting.
Every laugh is a moment stolen from sorrow.
The truth is cold and it hates you.
You are dancing on the edge of nothing.
The floor is shifting. You have no balance.
Time stopped just for you to feel this.
The chains are invisible, but unbreakable.
Only the echo of your breath remains.
You were born inside this cage.
The universe simply forgot your purpose.
Cold spaces.
Inside of void.
null is suffering for it.
lol.
